= Introduction =

I plan to outline how to create new Awesomeguy levels here. Awesomeguy levels are incorporated in an 'awesomeguy.xml' file, and currently to use custom levels you need to build your own xml file and then include it in the Eclipse Java project (which can be downloaded from this site. See: [http://code.google.com/p/awesomeguy/source/checkout http://code.google.com/p/awesomeguy/source/checkout]) and then make your own version of Awesomeguy from that. Soon a way will be made for the awesomeguy.xml file that you create to be loaded automatically from the android phone's sdcard. When that change has been made to the program this file will be updated. It is obvious that building the entire Eclipse Java project for Awesomeguy yourself just to incorporate your own levels in the game is a bit much for most readers, but for programmers the process wouldn't bee so difficult, and in any case the technical reader might find description of the process gives some incite into how the Awesomeguy game works in general.

===Tools and Programs===

The process requires that you have a working version of the 'Mappy' program. This program works well under Windows and in Linux under WINE. It can be found at [http://www.tilemap.co.uk/ www.tilemap.co.uk]. Mappy is free.

A copy of the Awesomeguy tilesheet is needed. This can be found in the SVN repository of the program, in the folder awesomeguy/res/drawable. The file to use is any one of the 'png' files that start with the 'tiles' prefix. It may be necessary to check out the entire project in order to download this file. The tile may also be available on the Awesomeguy download page. See: [http://code.google.com/p/awesomeguy/downloads/list http://code.google.com/p/awesomeguy/downloads/list]

A good text editor is required for the editing of the output of the Mappy program. It is also required for the constructing of the basic awesomeguy xml file before the Mappy data is added to it.

The 'sed' command was used to edit the Mappy data. The 'sed' command may not be available on all systems. On Windows systems it may be necessary to install cygwin or mingw to use 'sed'.

===Basic Structure===

Since the file that we are trying to create is an xml file, it has a somewhat strict structure. Below is an example of the structure of the file if only two levels were added.

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
<level number="1">
<horizontal>64</horizontal>
<vertical>32</vertical>
<tiles_level>
	... this is where your mappy data
	goes for level 1 ...
</tiles_level>
<tiles_objects>
	... this is where your mappy data
	goes for level 1 ...
</tiles_objects>
<last_level>false</last_level>
</level>

<level number="2">
<horizontal>64</horizontal>
<vertical>32</vertical>
<tiles_level>
	... this is where your mappy data
	goes for level 2 ...
</tiles_level>
<tiles_objects>
	... this is where your mappy data
	goes for level 2 ...
</tiles_objects>
<last_level>true</last_level>
</level>

</game>
}}}

The data that's stored in the xml file in the spaces between the tiles_level tags and between the tiles_objects tags is in the form of comma separated values. These tables of comma separated values are large and are not shown in the listing above.

Note that the original awesomeguy.xml file holds ten levels, and at this time your xml file must hold ten levels also. For this reason someone looking to experiment with a single level might have better luck editing the original xml file with a text editor rather than try to create all ten required levels all at once.

Also note that there is a place in each level definition block for the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the level. It is important to fill these tags with the correct info from the Mappy program. They cannot be left blank and they cannot have the wrong value. Also note that the number of entries in the tiles_level tags must be the same as the number of entries in the tiles_objects tags. The Awesomeguy program uses the 'horizontal' and 'vertical' attributes in the xml file to turn the comma separated values into two identically sized tables. These tables are used by the game to draw the background of each level.

=Editing Your Level=

The first step to making a level is to know what your finished level will be like before you start. Make a sketch or diagram to work from, or develop a detailed plan in your head. One consideration is the size of the level. The level cannot be larger than 96 x 96 tiles, but it cannot be smaller than 32 tiles horizontal and 24 tiles vertical. If your map is smaller than this it will not display correctly on the screen and the game may crash.

===Mappy===

Mappy is a complicated program and we only use a small portion of its functionality when we edit our levels. To start the editing process the first step is to start Mappy and go to the 'file' pull-down menu. Choose the 'New Map' option. The program displays a dialog window at this point. The window says 'Mappy: New Map (easy)'. Values in this dialog must be changed. The dialog says: 'Each tile is 32 pixels wide and 32 pixels high.' This must be changed so that the numbers '32' are replaced with the numbers '8'. Remember that each of our tiles is 8x8. 

Do not dismiss the 'New Map' dialog yet. We must enter the ultimate size of our map in the spaces provided before we move on. The default says 'I want my map to be 100 tiles wide and 100 tiles high'. If we leave these values at their default the game will not run. The values must be lowered to at least 96, but you may decide to make them much lower than that.

The 'New Map' dialog also has settings for Colors, which are in the form of radio buttons for 'True Color' or 'Paletted (8 bit)' color. For our purposes the default works fine. Click 'OK'. Another dialog pops up to remind you to load the tilesheet. That's the next step.

Go to the 'File' pull-down menu again and select the 'Import...' option. A box opens that allows you to specify which file to use as your tilesheet. Use the 'tiles1.png' file that you download from the Awesomeguy Downloads site. See: http://code.google.com/p/awesomeguy/downloads/list . If you are having trouble using ping files with Mappy, go to the Mappy site and follow instructions there for adding ping support to your Mappy install. See: http://www.tilemap.co.uk/ .
