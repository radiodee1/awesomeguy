= Introduction =

I plan to outline how to create new Awesomeguy levels here. Awesomeguy levels are incorporated in an 'awesomeguy.xml' file, and currently to use custom levels you need to build your own xml file and then include it in the Eclipse Java project (which can be downloaded from this site. See: [http://code.google.com/p/awesomeguy/source/checkout http://code.google.com/p/awesomeguy/source/checkout]) and then make your own version of Awesomeguy from that. Soon a way will be made for the awesomeguy.xml file that you create to be loaded automatically from the android phone's sdcard. When that change has been made to the program this file will be updated. It is obvious that building the entire Eclipse Java project for Awesomeguy yourself just to incorporate your own levels in the game is a bit much for most readers, but for programmers the process wouldn't bee so difficult, and in any case the technical reader might find description of the process gives some incite into how the Awesomeguy game works in general.

===Tools and Programs===

The process requires that you have a working version of the 'Mappy' program. This program works well under Windows and in Linux under WINE. It can be found at [http://www.tilemap.co.uk/ www.tilemap.co.uk]. Mappy is free.

A copy of the Awesomeguy tilesheet is needed. This can be found in the SVN repository of the program, in the folder awesomeguy/res/drawable. The file to use is any one of the 'png' files that start with the 'tiles' prefix. It may be necessary to check out the entire project in order to download this file. The tile may also be available on the Awesomeguy download page. See: [http://code.google.com/p/awesomeguy/downloads/list http://code.google.com/p/awesomeguy/downloads/list]

A good text editor is required for the editing of the output of the Mappy program. It is also required for the constructing of the basic awesomeguy xml file before the Mappy data is added to it.

The 'sed' command was used to edit the Mappy data. The 'sed' command may not be available on all systems. On Windows systems it may be necessary to install cygwin or mingw to use 'sed'.

===Basic Structure===

Since the file that we are trying to create is an xml file, it has a somewhat strict structure. Below is an example of the structure of the file if only two levels were added.

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
<level number="1">
<horizontal>64</horizontal>
<vertical>32</vertical>
<tiles_level>
	... this is where your mappy data
	goes for level 1 ...
</tiles_level>
<tiles_objects>
	... this is where your mappy data
	goes for level 1 ...
</tiles_objects>
<last_level>false</last_level>
</level>

<level number="2">
<horizontal>64</horizontal>
<vertical>32</vertical>
<tiles_level>
	... this is where your mappy data
	goes for level 2 ...
</tiles_level>
<tiles_objects>
	... this is where your mappy data
	goes for level 2 ...
</tiles_objects>
<last_level>true</last_level>
</level>

</game>
}}}

The data that's stored in the xml file in the spaces between the tiles_level tags and between the tiles_objects tags is in the form of comma separated values. These tables of comma separated values are large and are not shown in the listing above.

Note that the original awesomeguy.xml file holds ten levels, and at this time your xml file must hold ten levels also. For this reason someone looking to experiment with a single level might have better luck editing the original xml file with a text editor rather than try to create all ten required levels all at once.

Also note that there is a place in each level definition block for the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the level. It is important to fill these tags with the correct info from the Mappy program. They cannot be left blank and they cannot have the wrong value. Also note that the number of entries in the tiles_level tags must be the same as the number of entries in the tiles_objects tags.
