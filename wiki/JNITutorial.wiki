= Introduction =

Here we'll go through the steps of writing your own JNI library to use with the Android platform. We'll also touch on setting up your Android app editing environment using Eclipse.

= Overview =

Before you create your Android JNI file you need a working project, and before that you need a working development environment. In this tutorial we'll briefly cover setting up your eclipse IDE for java development, and we'll go on to cover Android JNI/NDK.

JNI stands for 'Java Native Interface' and NDK stands for 'Native Development Kit'. We'll use the two terms somewhat interchangeably but they could also be used to define very specific and different things. JNI could be used to define all Java applications that use native code, whereas NDK would be more related to the Android system in specific.

=Setup Environment=

Here we'll start looking at Eclipse and Android plugins. Awesomeguy was programmed on a debian-based linux computer. Instructions for installing software are generally written with a linux operating system in mind. However, Android apps can be successfully written on Windows computers, and all of the tools mentioned here have windows equivalents.

===Download Java===

You will also need a working version of Java on your computer to compile Android code. Sometimes you can run into problems if the version of Java you are using is not the official java. Oracle is the company responsible for the official java download at the time of this writing.

For distributions of linux that use complex packaging systems, java can usually be downloaded as a package. In a debian-based linux system, `update-alternatives` may be employed to make sure that the correct java implementation is being used on your system after the java packages are downloaded. You are interested in java 'jre' and java 'jdk', as well as anything else they require to operate correctly.


===Eclipse===

At the time of this writing, if you go to the Eclipse IDE web site, you'll find that the most recent version of Eclipse is 'Eclipse Helios' version 3.6.1 however that version won't work with the Android Development Kit. The link for the eclipse home page is:

http://www.eclipse.org/

====Download Eclipse====

Go to the eclipse home page and click the button for downloads. Do not download Eclipse Helios on this page. Look for a link for 'Older Versions'. Awesomeguy was written on 'Galileo' version 3.5.2. 


====File Folder Organization====

Make sure you can write and compile java code on Eclipse before moving on to the next step.
