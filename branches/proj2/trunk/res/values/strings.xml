        <string name="app_legal">LEGAL \n This version of Awesomeguy can report your game usage statistics to Google Analytics. This allows the developers to track
how many users actually play the game. Google Analytics does not change any aspect of game play, and it does not report
the identity of the users in any way. It DOES encourage the developers of the game to add features for future releases.
Google Analytics is enabled by default, but can be disabled easily from the Options screen.

        <string name="app_features">FEATURES \n This version of Awesomeguy supports game play in landscape mode. In this
mode the D-pad is re-arranged on the bottom of the screen in a single row. Awesomeguy should automatically re-orient
itself when the phone is turned. \n\n
When playing in portrait view using the touch buttons try playing the game with one finger. The pointer finger or the thumb work better for different people.
 (Hold the device in the other hand.) Depending on your phone, you can place the device on a table and press two buttons at a time - like one of the direction buttons and the jump button together. 
 This is harder to do if you are holding the device, and may not work for everyone. \n\n
When playing in landscape view you can use your thumbs to press the buttons.</string>
